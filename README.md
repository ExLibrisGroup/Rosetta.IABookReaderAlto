#Rosetta.IABookReaderAlto
The IA Book Reader is an External Viewer that can be integrated with Rosetta. The viewer has been enhanced to deliver jpg images with ALTO in the form of book pages and highlighted search terms.

For direct diployment, the ready war is under the dist folder.

We recommend deploying on an external application server. Ex Libris does not guarantee future changes to Rosetta will be compatible with the viewer. If you do deploy the viewer on an external server, you will need to configure the viewer.properties file situated under the conf folder: change localhost to your Rosetta server name.
